# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture for the MGM (Marketing de Afiliados) platform's Proof of Concept phase. The architecture is designed to support scalable affiliate marketing operations while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and high-speed data access
- **Message Queue**: Kafka for event processing and tracking

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux for global state
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with Tailwind CSS

## Core Components

### 1. Tracking System
- **Cookie Management**:
  - 30-day persistence
  - Cross-device tracking via fingerprinting
  - Fallback mechanisms for cookie-less environments

- **Fraud Detection**:
  - Click validation system
  - Anomaly detection
  - Manual review dashboard

- **Attribution System**:
  - Configurable attribution windows (7-30 days)
  - Multi-touch attribution support
  - Conversion conflict resolution

### 2. Campaign Management
- **Campaign Creation**:
  - Template-based setup
  - Commission rule engine
  - A/B testing support

- **Affiliate Management**:
  - Tiered affiliate system
  - Performance tracking
  - Commission calculation

### 3. Reporting System
- **Real-time Analytics**:
  - Click tracking
  - Conversion monitoring
  - Revenue analytics

- **Data Export**:
  - CSV/JSON formats
  - Scheduled reports
  - Custom report builder

## Data Flow

1. **Click Tracking Flow**:
```
User Click -> Load Balancer -> Tracking Service -> Kafka -> Processing Service -> PostgreSQL/Redis
```

2. **Conversion Flow**:
```
Conversion Event -> API Gateway -> Attribution Service -> Kafka -> Processing Service -> PostgreSQL
```

3. **Reporting Flow**:
```
Client Request -> API Gateway -> Report Service -> Redis/PostgreSQL -> Response
```

## Security Measures

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- API response times
- Error rates
- Conversion tracking accuracy
- System resource utilization

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Centralized log management
- Error tracking and alerting

## Performance Considerations

- Target response time: < 300ms
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime SLA target
- Horizontal scaling capability

## Backup and Recovery

- Daily automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Multi-region disaster recovery
- Regular backup testing

## Development Practices

### Code Standards
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode
- Unit test coverage requirements

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing
- Staging environment deployment
- Production deployment with rollback
- Performance regression testing

## Future Considerations

- Microservices architecture evolution
- Machine learning for fraud detection
- Enhanced real-time analytics
- Global CDN integration
